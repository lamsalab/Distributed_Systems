CSC 213: Distributed systems lab

We have all the major things set up. We have both the directory server and the clients set up as well. However, we must acknowledge that some parts dont work perfectly as they should. We are pretty confident about the directory server. We tested all its functionalities and it more or less works the way we want it to, although we might have missed out on some details in our testing. The main problem is on the client side code. We set the UI and the necessary threads. The first time we send messages it works. But, the subsequent transaction of data does not seem to occur. We suspect that there is some issue with the way we are reading and writing in the thread. We have a feeling its not a very big error. For instance, we were stuck for the longest time since we weren't appending '\n' in getline(). We suspect it is something similar to that. On a more positive side, we have verified that all the connections are set as needed, but once they are set up.
